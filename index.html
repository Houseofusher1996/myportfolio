<h3>Hello, I'm Christian!</h3>
  <p>I am a software engineer from New York.</p>
    <p>My interest in coding started at a young age when I took a few video game building classes at a summer camp my grandma sent me to. Eventually my interest grew as an adult into web development because I love the idea of creation, accomplishment, learning a new language, and challenging myself.</p>
    <p>Some other interests of mine include: biking, music, animals, and DIY projects.</p>
    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>I am a full-time Thinkful student in the process of accomplishing my goals and achieving my dreams. I love learning and my goal right now is to be a software engineer. I have many pets and I enjoy challenges.</p>
    <h3>Please feel free to get in touch with me!</h3>
