<h3>Hello, I'm Christian!</h3>
  <p>I am a software engineer from New York.</p>
  <hr>
    <h3>About me</h3>
  <p>I am 
    <ol>
      <li>26 years old</li>
      <li>a full time Thinkful student</li>
      <li>interested in being part of a team</li>
      <li>a well-rounded and motivated individual</li>
  </ol>
  <p>I am in the process of accomplishing my goals and achieving my dreams. I love learning and my goal right now is to be a software engineer. I have many pets and I enjoy challenges.</p>
    <p>My interest in coding started at a young age when I took a few video game building classes at a summer camp my grandma sent me to. Eventually my interest grew as an adult into web development because I love the idea of creation, accomplishment, learning a new language, and challenging myself.</p>
    <p>I enjoy working with others and being part of a team and I love to help people!</p>
    <p>Some other interests of mine include
      <ul>
